"""
Simple test for neuromodulated-STDP incorporating structural plasticity

We take 10 populations of 49 stimuli neurons and connect to each 10
populations of 49 neurons using  a straightforward creation/elimination
structural method (similar to that used in the struct_pl examples).  Then we
connect each of these 10 populations (via one-to-one connections) to
10 post-synaptic populations of 49 neurons.

The spiking of stimuli causes some spikes in post-synaptic neurons initially.
We then inject reward signals from dopaminergic neurons
periodically to reinforce synapses that are active. This
is followed by increased weights of some synapses and thus
increased response to the stimuli.
We then proceed to inject punishment signals from dopaminergic
neurons which causes an inverse effect to reduce response of
post-synaptic neurons to the same stimuli.
