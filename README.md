# MySpiNNakerProblems

A somewhat random collection of scripts and bits of code used
on the SpiNNaker platform using the [SpiNNaker toolchain](http://github.com/SpiNNakerManchester/).  Added to as and when I see fit,
mainly with bits of user code / scripts when trying to troubleshoot
problems, usually via the SpiNNaker Google groups mailing list.
