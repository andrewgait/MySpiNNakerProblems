\chapter[Snappy Synapses (2)]{Snappy Synapses (2):\\
Fast Synaptic Rows and Rowlets\\
{\it Streamlining SpiNNaker, Part IV}}

This is the much discussed division of an entire synaptic row into
chunks whose length corresponds to the available ring-buffer space.

We will also discuss fast methods for indexing into the SDRAM space where
the rows are stored.

\section{Decoupling Spike Handling}

There are now {\em two} processes in play: getting the address of the
relevant first synaptic rowlet, and then organising that the rowlets
are pre-fetched (and maybe, even copied into the ring buffer) prior to
the time-step in which they are actually needed.

This then results in significantly less time pressdure on the DMA
engine. The assumption I'm making is that we postpone processing the
pre-fetched rowlets until we have reset the ring buffer elements used
as inputs in the current time-step -- thereby freeing what will become
the {\em last} delay slot of the ring buffers in the next time-step.
